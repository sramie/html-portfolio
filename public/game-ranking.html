        <h3>Suikoden</h3>
        <p>
            Probably one of my favorite games from my childhood, Suikoden is a JRPG with a supporting
            cast of 108 playable characters.  While searching for all your potential companions, you also
            build up a base to house everyone, collect elemental runes for combat, assign troop leaders and
            command full scale battles, and you can even enjoy mini games from your companions.  This gaming 
            experience has a little everything to keep you entertained.

        <h3>Minecraft</h3>
        <p>
            This game is an clean canvas for your imagination - you can create whatever you can conceive.
            It's a survival, it's a building game, it's literally whatever you want it to be and that's 
            the beauty of Minecraft.

        <h3>The Last of Us</h3>
        <p>
            Out of all the games I've ever played this was the first one to make such an emotional impact on me;
            the writing is just so spot on.  The character growth between Joel and Ellie...and that scene with 
            Ellie and the giraffes, I'll never forget how heartbreaking it was.

        <h3>The Witcher 3</h3>
        <p>
            CDPR really hit it out of the park with the Witcher.  I enjoyed all three games, but the third
            installment was by far the best.  The monster hunter who always managed to discover that humans
            were the true monsters of the land with those memorially written quests and characters.  Roaming
            the countryside on your trusted companion, Roach, collecting trophies, and trying to not get
            entangled in politics.

        <h3>Borderlands 2</h3>
        <p>
            This is just an all around fun shooter to play with friends and have a great time.  I know Gearbox
            has attempted to strike gold again with BL3 and PreSequel, but my friends and I always return to 
            BL2.

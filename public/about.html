<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida and I've had the pleasure of living in a select few states of the southeast
  United States.  I've recently made the journey from Stanford, Kentucky to Zwiesel, Germany where my husband and I 
  were married.  I've had a wonderful time adapting to my new life in a foreign country!</p>

<p>I enjoy learning diverse things which has brought me interesting experiences, some of which include becoming the 
  editor for my school newspaper, volunteering for the Mote Marine Aquarium, interning in a comic book studio, working 
  in a car garage, Alpha and Beta testing numerous console/PC/mobile games, and raid leading groups ranging from 10 - 40
  people from all time zones and nationalities. 
  I have a borderline insane curiosity to understand how things work. The process of sitting down, getting my hands 
  dirty, and looking at a situation from every angle has been a driving force behind my success.</p>

<p>In my free time you can find me learning German, rockhounding, listening to my eclectic music playlists, reading 
comics, webtoons or high fantasy, serving my Siberian Husky(Baldr), and playing Pathfinder and video games with my 
friends.</p>
